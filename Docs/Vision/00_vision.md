## BrainGymWhy - The Problem Statement

In the age of low attention timespan where people are scrolling mindlessly, attention timespan has been reduced to 8% globally. In the Age of AI, critical thinking is not a compulsion and is rapidly declining. 

People face challenges with:
- **Sustained focus** - inability to maintain attention on tasks for extended periods
- **Task-switching** - difficulty managing multiple tasks or transitioning between activities effectively
- **Analytical reasoning** - reduced capacity for deep, logical analysis of information
- **Overthinking** - getting stuck in unproductive thought loops
- **Shallow thinking** - surface-level processing without depth or nuance

## Target Audience
- **Primary users:** Company employees

## Solution Vision
- **Core approach:** Gamified learning backed by neuroscience
- **User flow:** Employee plays a game → gets a brain score → receives personalized exercises to improve
- **Key differentiators:** Gamified Learning

## Neuroscience-Backed Assessment Games

### Core Cognitive Tests
**1. Stroop Test - "Color Clash"**
- **Purpose:** Measures cognitive inhibition and attention control
- **Mechanic:** Identify ink color while ignoring word meaning
- **Addresses:** Cognitive control declining from mindless scrolling
- **Why:** Most widely recognized and validated cognitive test globally

**2. N-Back Test - "Memory Chain"**
- **Purpose:** Measures working memory and cognitive load capacity
- **Mechanic:** Remember stimuli from N steps back in sequence
- **Addresses:** Attention span and working memory deficits
- **Why:** Extensively validated for cognitive training research

**3. Continuous Performance Test (CPT) - "Focus Guardian"**
- **Purpose:** Measures sustained attention over extended periods
- **Mechanic:** Maintain vigilance and respond to specific targets over time
- **Addresses:** 8% global attention span decline directly
- **Why:** Specifically designed to measure attention degradation

### Additional Assessment Options
**4. Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - "Pattern Detective"**
- **Purpose:** Tests cognitive flexibility and set-shifting
- **Addresses:** Analytical reasoning and adaptability

**5. Tower of London - "Strategic Builder"**
- **Purpose:** Planning and multi-step problem-solving
- **Addresses:** Critical thinking and strategic planning

**6. Task-Switching Paradigm - "Mental Gymnast"**
- **Purpose:** Measures mental flexibility between different cognitive tasks
- **Addresses:** Task-switching difficulties in modern work environments

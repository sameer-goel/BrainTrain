# Neuroscience Research Document

## Expert Consultations
*[To be populated with neuroscientist interviews and consultations]*

### Key Research Questions:
- Which cognitive training methods have strongest evidence for workplace performance improvement?
- How do the selected tests (Stroop, N-Back, CPT) translate to real-world attention and critical thinking gains?
- What's the optimal frequency and duration for cognitive training sessions?
- How long does it take to see measurable cognitive improvements?
- What are the neuroplasticity mechanisms behind these improvements?

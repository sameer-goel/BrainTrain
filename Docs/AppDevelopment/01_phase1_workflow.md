## Step 5: Feedback & Iteration Phase

### 5.1 Iteration Decision Matrix

**If Client Feedback = "APPROVED":**
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** → Move to Phase 2
- Document final approved design
- Prepare handover documentation

**If Client Feedback = "NEEDS_CHANGES":**
- 🔄 **Minor Iteration Loop**
- UX/UI Designer AI makes requested changes
- Full Stack Developer AI implements changes
- QA Engineer AI validates changes
- Return to Client Review

**If Client Feedback = "MAJOR_REVISION":**
- 🔄 **Full Iteration Loop**
- Return to Step 1 with new requirements
- Solutions Architect AI may need to revise architecture
- UX/UI Designer AI creates new/modified variants
- Full implementation and testing cycle

### 5.2 Iteration Tracking
**Each iteration is tracked with:**
- Iteration number (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
- Changes requested and implemented
- Time to complete iteration
- Client satisfaction score
- Lessons learned for next iteration

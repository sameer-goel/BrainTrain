- Colorful, game-like interface
- Progress bars, badges, and achievements
- Animated feedback and celebrations

**Variant C: Scientific/Medical**
- Clean, clinical design with data focus
- Charts and graphs prominent
- Minimal distractions, focus on metrics

**Client Collaboration Process:**
1. UX/UI Designer AI creates 3 variants for each major component
2. Full Stack Developer AI implements all variants with feature flags
3. Client reviews and provides feedback
4. Iterate until client approves final design direction

#### 1.4 Core Features
- [ ] User authentication (mock login system)
- [ ] User dashboard with progress overview
- [ ] Test selection and execution interface
- [ ] Results display and history
- [ ] Progress tracking and analytics
- [ ] Personalized exercise recommendations

#### 1.5 Mock Data System
- [ ] 50+ mock employee profiles
- [ ] 1000+ historical test results
- [ ] 6 months of progress data simulation
- [ ] Realistic usage patterns and analytics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All 3 cognitive tests fully functional
- [ ] Client-approved UI design implemented
- [ ] Responsive design working on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Mock data integration complete
- [ ] Local performance: <2 second load times
- [ ] All core user flows tested and validated
- [ ] Client green light for Phase 2

### Phase 1 Timeline
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 weeks
- Week 1: Setup, core tests, initial UI variants
- Week 2: UI iteration and client collaboration
- Week 3: Final implementation and testing

- [ ] SSL certificate configuration
- [ ] Deployment automation workflow

#### 2.3 Production Optimization
- [ ] Code minification and optimization
- [ ] Asset optimization (images, CSS, JS)
- [ ] Performance optimization for web hosting
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

#### 2.4 Documentation & Handover
- [ ] Technical documentation
- [ ] User guide and instructions
- [ ] Maintenance and update procedures
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring setup

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

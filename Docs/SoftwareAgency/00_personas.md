|----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Product Manager AI** | Product Owner, All AI Agents | All AI Agents | Strategy, Priorities, Coordination |
| **Solutions Architect AI** | Product Manager AI | Product Manager AI, Full Stack Developer AI | Architecture, Security, Tech Stack |
| **UX/UI Designer AI** | Product Manager AI | Full Stack Developer AI | User Experience, Visual Design |
| **Full Stack Developer AI** | Solutions Architect AI, UX/UI Designer AI | QA Engineer AI, DevOps AI | Implementation, Code Quality |
| **QA Engineer AI** | Full Stack Developer AI | Product Manager AI, Full Stack Developer AI | Testing, Quality Gates |
| **DevOps Automation AI** | Full Stack Developer AI | Monitoring AI | Deployment, Infrastructure |
| **Monitoring & Analytics AI** | DevOps AI, Full Stack Developer AI | Product Manager AI, All Agents | System Health, Performance |

### Workflow Phase Ownership

| Phase | Primary Owner | Supporting Agents |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Requirements** | Product Manager AI | UX/UI Designer AI |
| **Architecture** | Solutions Architect AI | Product Manager AI |
| **Design** | UX/UI Designer AI | Product Manager AI |
| **Implementation** | Full Stack Developer AI | Solutions Architect AI, UX/UI Designer AI |
| **Testing** | QA Engineer AI | Full Stack Developer AI |

### Conflict Resolution Hierarchy

1. **Technical Conflicts** → Solutions Architect AI decides
2. **UX/Design Conflicts** → UX/UI Designer AI decides  
3. **Quality Conflicts** → QA Engineer AI decides
4. **Deployment Conflicts** → DevOps Automation AI decides
5. **Cross-Domain Conflicts** → Product Manager AI mediates
6. **Unresolved Conflicts** → Escalate to Product Owner

### Autonomous Operation Rules

- **No Direct Communication** between non-adjacent agents (must go through defined interfaces)
- **Clear Decision Boundaries** - each agent owns specific decision types
- **Escalation Protocols** - automatic escalation after 3 failed attempts
- **Status Transparency** - all agents report status to Product Manager AI every 2 hours

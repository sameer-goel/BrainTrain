### Communication Flow Rules

**1. Status Updates (Work-Based, Not Time-Based)**
- All agents report status after **completing each task** or **reaching a milestone**
- All agents report status when **blocked** or **need input from another agent**
- Product Manager AI consolidates and reports to Product Owner after **each sprint/feature completion**

**2. Conflict Resolution Protocol (Updated)**
```
Conflict Detected → Domain Expert AI decides first →
If cross-domain → Product Manager AI mediates →
If unresolved → Escalate to Product Owner →
Decision implemented → All agents notified
```

**3. Loop Detection & Prevention**
- Maximum 3 iterations on same task before escalation
- Automatic escalation if **no measurable progress** after 3 attempts
- Progress measured by **deliverable completion**, not time spent

**4. Communication Interface Rules**
- **No Direct Communication** between non-adjacent agents
- All communication flows through defined interfaces
- Product Manager AI can communicate with all agents
- Monitoring & Analytics AI can send alerts to all agents

**4. Phase Progression Gates**
```
